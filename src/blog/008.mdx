React 19's new `useActionState` hook simplifies handling asynchronous operations in React, especially when dealing with forms. Let's delve into a practical example to see it in action.

Here we have a simple read-only form ready for submission:

```typescript
"use client";

export const FormAction = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <form>
        <input type="text" name="name" value="Hello from actions" readOnly />
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
      </form>
      <footer>
        <p>Awaiting action üöÄ</p>
      </footer>
    </div>
  );
};
```

The `useActionState` hook takes a minimum of two arguments: (1) an asynchronous action, that in turn takes its own arguments of `previousState` and a generic payload, and (2) an initial state. This hook returns (a) the awaited state, (b) a dispatcher and (c) an `isPending` boolean.

```typescript
// canary.d.ts
export function useActionState<State, Payload>(
  action: (state: Awaited<State>, payload: Payload) => State | Promise<State>,
  initialState: Awaited<State>
): [
  state: Awaited<State>,
  dispatch: (payload: Payload) => void,
  isPending: boolean
];
```

So let's define our state's type definition along with our initial state value to begin shaping our component.

```typescript
"use client";

import { useActionState } from "react";

type State = { data: string; status: "SUCCESS" } | { status: "ERROR" | "INIT" };
const initState: State = { status: "INIT" };

export const FormAction = () => {
  const [action, submitAction, isPending] = useActionState(
    async (prevState: State, formData: FormData) =>
      runAction(prevState, String(formData.get("name"))),
    initState
  );

  return (
    <div>
      <form action={submitAction}>
        <input type="text" name="name" value="Hello from actions" readOnly />
        <button type="submit" disabled={isPending}>
          Submit
        </button>
      </form>
      <footer>
        {action.status === "INIT" && <p>Awaiting action üöÄ</p>}
        {action.status === "SUCCESS" && <p>Success, all good ‚úÖ</p>}
        {action.status === "ERROR" && <p>Error, please resubmit action ‚ùå</p>}
        <code>{JSON.stringify({ isPending })}</code>
        <code>{JSON.stringify(action)}</code>
      </footer>
    </div>
  );
};
```

- Notice how `submitAction`, a function generated by `useActionState`, is used directly in the form's `action` attribute. This moves away from the form pattern of using callbacks `onSubmit`.
- The submission button is disabled based on `isPending` which allows us to manage state effectively.
- As for the form's feedback mechanism, it responds dynamically to changes in action's `state`.

The `runAction` function here is a mock, simulating an API call which randomly succeds or fails returning a new state, updating the form's status to either `SUCCESS` or `ERROR`. This could or could not be a [Server Action](https://www.webscope.io/blog/server-actions-resend).

```typescript
async function runAction(_prevState: State, data: string) {
  return new Promise<State>((r) => {
    setTimeout(
      () =>
        Math.random() < 0.5
          ? r({ data, status: "SUCCESS" })
          : r({ status: "ERROR" }),
      1500
    );
  });
}
```

> **Gotcha**: while this pattern allows you to keep your UI responsive, you need to design how to handle errors. This hook doesn't return an error member, so regardless if you are using a Server Action (where you can't throw errors) or not, you might have to follow the pattern showcased here integrating errors in the action's state.

Why not leverage `useActionState` in your next React project? What do you think? Does it make it easier or not to to manage state, side effects and boilerplate in form operations?
