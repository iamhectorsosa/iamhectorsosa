Inside your Next application, your `next.config.js` file is a regular Node module used by the server and build phases where you can configure rewrites and redirects for your application. What's the difference between them?

- [Rewrites](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/rewrites) allow you to map a request path to a different destination as a URL proxy (masking the destination path, without changing the User's location at all).
- In contrast, [redirects](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/redirects) will reroute you to a new page fully disclosing the destination URL.

Both of them are _async_ functions that return at least an array of objects that require the following key-value pairs: `source`, `destination`, `permanent` (only for _redirects_). Rewrites can be incredibly useful to temporarily map old paths: `/old-blog/:slug` to `/new-blog/:slug` ensuring there are no broken links in your application. However, let's say if you'd want to map `/github` to your GH profile. Here, you'd use a _redirect_ instead.

```js
/*** `next.config.js` ***/
module.exports = {
  async redirects() {
    return [
      {
        source: "/github",
        // `source` type `String` - is the incoming request path pattern
        destination: "https://github.com/iamhectorsosa",
        // `destination` type `String` - is the path you want to route to
        permanent: true,
        // `permanent` type `Boolean` Only for Redirects
        // `true` will use 308 to cache the redirect
        // `false` will use 307 as temporary
      },
    ];
  },
};
```

Vercel also offers a solution for _redirects_ and _rewrites_ within their `vercel.json` [Project config](https://vercel.com/docs/project-configuration) file. Here, [redirects](https://vercel.com/docs/project-configuration#project-configuration/redirects) and [rewrites](https://vercel.com/docs/project-configuration#project-configuration/rewrites) are **framework agnostic**. You can use them with any framework supported on their platform. However, in case of a Next.js application, Vercel recommends **framework level redirects** as they do have precedence over platform level redirects. Here's [Lee Rob](https://twitter.com/leeerob)'s [project config file](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io/blob/main/vercel.json).

## What about subdomains?

With subdomains such as `subdomain.domain.com`, Vercel explains this incredibly easy (here's their [redirecting subdomain guide](https://vercel.com/guides/can-i-redirect-from-a-subdomain-to-a-subpath)). In short, let's say you want to rewrite `app.acme.com` to `acme.com/app`, you'll need to configure a rewrite making use of the `has` field.

```js
/*** `vercel.json` ***/
{
  "rewrites": [
    // Requests to app.acme.com, will be rewritten to acme.com/app.
    {
      "source": "/:path*",
      "has": [
        {
          "type": "host",
          "value": "app.acme.com"
        }
      ],
      "destination": "/app/:path*"
    }
  ]
}
```
